  About National Education Policy (NEP) 2020</h2></center>
  <ul>
    <li><i>
  The National Policy on Education was framed in 1986 and modified in 1992. Since then several
     changes have taken place that calls for a revision of the Policy. </i></li><br>
     <li><i>The NEP 2020 is  the first education policy of the 21st century and replaces the thirty-four year old National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986. Built on the foundational pillars of Access, Equity, Quality, Affordability and Accountability, this policy is aligned to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and aims to transform India into a vibrant knowledge society and global knowledge superpower by making both school and college education more holistic, flexible, multidisciplinary, 
      suited to 21st century needs and aimed at bringing out the unique capabilities of each student.</i></li>

Infrastructure support, innovative education centres to bring back dropouts into the mainstream, tracking of students and their learning levels, facilitating multiple pathways to learning involving 
      both formal and non-formal education modes, association of counselors or well-trained social workers with schools, open learning for classes3,5 and 8 through NIOS and State Open Schools, secondary education programs
       equivalent to Grades 10 and 12, vocational courses, adult literacy and life-enrichment programs are some of the proposed ways for achieving this. About 2 crore out of school children will be brought back into main stream under NEP 2020.</i></li>

        This will bring the hitherto uncovered age group of 3-6 years under school curriculum,
